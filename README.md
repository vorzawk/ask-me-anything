# Ask Me Anything
A Neural network model which can take a passage of text as input and answer questions about it. The implemented model is a Recurrent Neural Network that uses the concept of [Co-attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01604) to answer the questions. The [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) dataset is used to train the model. The model achieves an F1-Score of 67.37% while answering questions.

### Examples
Here are some examples of the model in action. It is seen that the model is able to do a good job of ignoring the details that are not relevant to the question and choosing the correct answer.
